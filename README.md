# MSc-thesis-Increasing-the-computing-efficiency-of-GUARDYAN

This is my largest project at the university. The thesis is written in english.

The topic of increasing the computing efficiency if very diverse. My job was to try to implement zero variance Monte Carlo simulations in different geometries.

As of 2022.04.25. the project is not yet finished, everything is a subject of change!
